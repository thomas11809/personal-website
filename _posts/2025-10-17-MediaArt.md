*"What happens when Korean shamanism meets AI?"*

This fascinating question was the starting point for a collaboration with Seungyeon Sun, then a Master's student in the Department of Sculpture at the College of Fine Arts. 
<!--more-->
Her vision was to create a new virtual character by merging her face with images of a 'Mudang' (a Korean shaman) and to produce a short video of this character performing a 'Gut' (a traditional Korean shamanistic ritual).

The primary challenge was immediately clear: "Korean shamanism" is a highly specific and regional cultural theme, and there was a severe lack of readily available data to train an AI model from scratch.

As a deep learning expert, I took on the technical challenge of bringing this powerful artistic concept to life. This collaboration resulted in three unique media art video pieces. This post serves as a high-level overview of the project, the exhibitions that featured it, and the artworks we created.

### Exhibition Overview: Posters & Snapshots
Over the course of this project, our work was featured in four separate exhibitions. Here are the posters from each show, along with snapshots from the galleries.

<strong>[Gallery Snapshots]</strong>
<p>To share the full atmosphere of the exhibitions, I've compiled a snapshot portfolio into a single PDF. It captures the project's core theme, "When AI Meets Korean Shamanism," by showcasing the related sculptures, the media art itself, and the live dance performance that helped realize the digital artwork.

### The 3 AI-Generated Media Artworks
We created three distinct video pieces, each leveraging a different generative AI technique to explore the central theme.

1.  **Charye (차례)**  
    The first piece, 'Charye', is based on the traditional Korean ancestral memorial rite. We started with real-world video footage of the ritual.

    -   **Technique:** We used Stable Diffusion v1 to perform style transfer on keyframes from the video, giving them an artistic, surreal quality. Since editing every single frame was impractical, we used EbSynth (Example-based Synthesizing) to interpolate the frames *between* our stylized keyframes, ensuring a smooth and temporally consistent video.
    -   **Result:** A dream-like, stylized re-interpretation of a traditional Korean ceremony.

2.  **GUT_choice (굿_초이스)**  
    This piece directly tackled the artist's initial concept of a 'Gut' ritual. We filmed a professional dancer performing traditional Korean dance.

    -   **Technique:** We employed a GAN-based deep learning model for face swapping. The "target face" wasn't just one face; we generated multiple target faces based on various emotional prompts (e.g., "sadness," "joy," "anger"). We then created several versions of the video, each with a different "emotional" face swapped onto the dancer.
    -   **Result:** The final artwork is the entire collection of these videos, presenting a "choice" of emotions for the ritual, questioning artifice and expression in a digital age.

3.  **vivarium (비바리움)**  
    The final piece is a sensory video that explores a real-world space associated with Korean traditional religion.

    -   **Technique:** We trained a NeRF (Neural Radiance Fields) model using video footage of the actual location (after estimating camera poses). Once the 3D scene was optimized, we rendered a new video by defining a custom, non-human camera path that weaves through the space.
    -   **Result:** The camera's movement feels untethered from reality, creating a "ghost-like" or "spirit-like" perspective. It gives the viewer the feeling of an ethereal entity wandering and exploring this spiritual space.

### Technical Challenges & Next Steps
This project was an incredible journey at the intersection of artistic vision and deep learning technology. Adapting generative models to such a culturally specific theme was a significant and rewarding challenge.

In this post, I've provided a general overview of the project. In my next post, I will dive deep into the specific technical details, including:

- Style Transfer with Stable Diffusion v1
- Video interpolation using EbSynth
- GAN-based Face Swapping
- NeRF training and video rendering from estimated camera poses

<!-- Stay tuned for the technical breakdown! -->
