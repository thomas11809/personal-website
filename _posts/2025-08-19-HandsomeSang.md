In this post, I want to share one of the stories from my start-up team archives (Airus) about a project that I co-developed back in August 2023.
The project was called "Handsome Sang", which is an abbreviation for "Handsome Teacher" in Korean.

While it never went beyond the concept stage, our team built a PoC (Proof of Concept) to implement the concept and conducted market analysis through various tests.
This process taught me valuable lessons about product, market, and allowed me to directly experience of the gap between an AI-driven idea and a viable business.
This post is a retrospective, a case study of that journey.

### The Spark: What Was the Problem We Saw?
Our journey began with a simple observation of the Korean online education market.
South Korea pioneered the "In-gang" (online lecture) industry, and over the years, the quality of lectures had become incredibly high and largely standardized.
We felt that the industry had hit a plateau in terms of traditional competitiveness like lecture quality itself.
**How could a new player stand out when lecture quality was already a given?**

> Our core hypothesis was this: What if we approached education with the logic of the entertainment industry?

Celebrities and K-pop idols, for example, capture attention and drive engagement not only with just their talent, but also through their visual appeal.
We theorized that if online lectures were taught by hyper-realistic, AI-generated instructors with the looks of celebrities, we could significantly boost student concentration and engagement.

The problem we aimed to solve wasn't a lack of quality content, but a lack of engagement in a saturated market.
For instance, numerous global studies support this correlation (often citing the **Halo Effect** or **Source Attractiveness Model**):  
`"Appearance → Perceived Attractiveness → Perceived Trust and Expertise (Halo Effect) → Increased Purchase Intention."`

### The Solution: A Multi-Faceted Edutainment Platform
"Handsome Sang" was envisioned as more than just pretty faces. 
It was a blend of education, fan culture ("덕질" in Korean), and personalized mentorship.

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="{{ "/assets/images/Airus/HandsomeSang/sample1.png" | relative_url }}" alt="Source face image generated by SDv1" style="max-width: 30%; height: auto;">
  <p style="font-style: italic; color: #555; font-size: 0.9em;">Source face image generated by SDv1</p>
</div>

Our proposed solution had several layers:

1. **AI-Generated Instructors:**  
Using face-swapping technology (like Stable Diffusion derivatives), we planned to create visually stunning virtual teachers. 
This would not only make learning more engaging but also cleverly bypass potential IP issues by creating unique, celebrity-inspired faces rather than using real people directly.

2. **Engaging Content Formats:**  
 We didn't want to just replace a real person with a virtual one. We brainstormed interactive content like personalized greetings ("Hey *Student's Name*, how was your day?"), fan-centric merchandise (photocards with our virtual tutors), and even using LLMs to create a "Bubble-like" chat service for mentorship and mental support.

3. **Strategic Go-to-Market:**  
Our initial targets were B2C markets with global appeal: TOEIC for the domestic market and Korean language for international K-wave fans. 
The long-term vision was to pivot to a B2B model, providing our AI-swap technology as a service to major educational institutions like *Megastudy*, or even to the film industry.

### The Reality Check: How We Planned to Test Our Assumptions
An idea is just a hypothesis. To test ours, we designed a lean experiment based on the XYZ framework:

- **Hypothesis:** We believe that at least 30% of students learning a language (like Korean or English for TOEIC) would pay a 30% premium over average lecture prices for a course taught by a visually appealing AI instructor.

- **The Experiment:** Our plan was to create several YouTube Shorts. These short-form videos would feature an AI-swapped instructor teaching a simple Korean phrase or a quick TOEIC tip. The content would be designed to be highly shareable among K-culture fans.

- **Measuring Success:** In the video's comments or bio, we would place a link to a "pre-registration" page for the full course. This would be a classic "fake door" test. We wouldn't actually charge anyone, but the number of clicks and submission attempts on the payment form would give us crucial data on purchase intent.

Even in this planning phase, we identified significant technical hurdles, such as the unnatural "artifacts" created by face-swapping on side profiles and the challenge of maintaining frame-to-frame consistency.

### What I Learned from a Project That Never Launched
"Handsome Sang" now lives on as a document in my cloud storage, but the intellectual exercise was incredibly valuable. Here are my key takeaways:

1. Execution is the Real Moat: The core idea of "AI tutors" isn't unique. We quickly realized our competitive advantage wouldn't be the idea itself, but our ability to execute on the technical details-creating AI avatars that were genuinely appealing and not trapped in the "uncanny valley."

2. The Power of a Niche Entry Point: In retrospect, targeting K-culture fans learning Korean was the strongest part of our strategy. It was a passionate, globally-distributed community that was more likely to embrace the novelty of our "edutainment" approach. Starting with a broad market like the entire SAT prep industry would have been a mistake.

3. Process Over Outcome: While this project didn't turn into a business, it forced me to think like a product manager. I learned to define a problem, articulate a value proposition, brainstorm business models, and design a low-cost experiment to test a core assumption. This structured thinking is just as valuable in academic research as it is in a startup.

Sharing this is a reminder that not every idea needs to become a unicorn. Some ideas serve a different purpose: they become the foundation for learning, growth, and the next, better idea.
