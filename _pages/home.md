### About Me

**I am an AI researcher exploring the frontiers of technology through research, ventures, and art.**

As a Ph.D. Candidate in Computer Vision, my work spans from publishing high-impact generative AI research to building real-world applications.
I've co-founded two startups where I architected core 3D vision pipelines and created media art using 3D Neural Rendering and GAN-based Face Swaps, which was finally exhibited at the Seoul Arts Center.

This website is a space to share my research findings, technical experiences, and deeper thoughts on the "how" and "why" of building at the edge of AI.
